We are able to shorthand IP addresses by simply dropping zero's. This could be useful for bypassing filters looking for IP Addresses as an input.

```
http://52.52
http://44.1
http://1.1
```

Also, according to the official RFC, the following format is also valid:

```
192.168.257 = 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.516 = 192.168.2.4
```

We can also represent `127.0.0.1` as `http://2130706433/`

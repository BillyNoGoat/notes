### Fundamentals
The core problem with web apps is that all user input is untrusted.
Core issues:
- Preventing application data from being distributed to unauthorised users
- Handling user input to prevent malicious input
- Ensuring application behaves appropriately during an attack
- Monitoring activities

Together these make up the vast majority of an application's attack surface.
